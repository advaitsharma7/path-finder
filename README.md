## **Path Finder Visualizer**

**Live Preview:** [https://path-finder-ee6d3.web.app/](https://path-finder-ee6d3.web.app/)

Utilized A\*, Uniform Cost search, Greedy Best First Search and Breadth First Search to create visualizations to demonstrate the working of these algorithms.

Created a modified Priority Queue Class using python heapq module to implement these algorithms.

### **Prerequisites**

- Knowledge about Searching Algorithms
- HTML/CSS/JS
- OOPs Programming

### **Functionality**

- Start Node is represented by Red Cell
- Goal Node is represented by Green Cell
- Explored Nodes are represented by Blue Cells
- Path Nodes are represented by Yellow Cells
- Bomb Nodes have a negative weight associated with them so passing through these nodes is costly. These are represented by B Letter Cells
- Wall Nodes are the nodes that the path should not include and are represented by Dark Gray Cells
